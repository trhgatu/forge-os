# 🔥 Forge OS — An Operating System for Thought, Growth & Creation

“A system that mirrors you, evolves with you,
and lights up the parts you don’t usually see.”

---

## ✨ What is Forge OS?

Forge OS is a **personal operating system** for reflection, creativity, and inner evolution.
Not a dashboard.
Not a CMS.
Not another productivity tool.

It is a **mind mirror** — helping you see deeper.
A **creative forge** — where ideas take form.
A **knowledge sanctuary** — storing the moments, insights, and truths that shape you.

A system designed to:

- store your **memories**,
- carry your **quotes**,
- track your **moods**,
- map your **timeline**,
- and host the **AI agents** that accompany your growth.

Forge OS isn’t just software —
it’s a living extension of your inner world.

## 🏗 Architecture

Built using **NestJS** and structured through **Domain-Driven Design**, ensuring clarity, boundary integrity, and long-term scalability.

### Structure Overview

```
trhgatu-forge-os-backend/
├── src/
│   ├── contexts/
│   │   ├── reflection/
│   │   ├── creation/
│   │   ├── mind/
│   │   └── system/
│   ├── core/
│   ├── shared/
│   └── app.module.ts
├── docker/

```

Each context behaves like a subsystem —
self-contained, expressive, and extendable.

## 🌐 Forge Chamber — Multi-Agent AI Room

A dedicated space where multiple AI personas coexist, collaborate, and respond simultaneously.
Each agent represents a perspective: logic, creativity, memory, philosophy.

Together, they form a **council of intelligence**
designed to expand your thinking and deepen your self-understanding.

## 🌠 Vision

Forge OS is designed as a **lifelong system** —
a companion that grows, transforms, and expands alongside you.

Not a project.
A living journey.
